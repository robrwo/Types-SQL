=head1 NAME

Types::SQL::Util - Extract DBIx::Class column_info from types

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Types::SQL -types;
  use Types::Standard -types;

  use Types::SQL::Util;

  my $type = Maybe[ Varchar[64] ];

  my %info = column_info_from_type( $type );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a utility function that translates types into
column information.

=head1 EXPORTS

=head2 C<column_info_from_type>

  my %info = column_info_from_type( $type );

This function returns a hash of column information for the
C<add_column> method of L<DBIx::Class::ResultSource>, based on the
type.

Besides the types from L<Types::SQL>, it also supports the following
types from L<Types::Standard>:

=head3 C<Maybe>

This treats the type in the parameter as nullable.

=head3 C<Enum>

This is treated as an C<enum> type, which can be used with
L<DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::Object::Enum>.

=head3 C<Int>

This is treated as an C<integer> without a precision.

=head3 C<Str>

This is treated as a C<text> value without a size.

=head3 C<InstanceOf>

For L<DateTime>, L<Time::Moment> and L<Time::Piece> objects, this is
treated as a C<datetime>.

=head1 CUSTOM TYPES

You can declare custom types from these types and still extract column
information from them:

  use Type::Library
    -base,
    -declare => qw/ CustomStr /;

  use Type::Utils qw/ -all /;
  use Types::SQL -types;
  use Types::SQL::Util;

  declare CustomStr, as Varchar [64];

  ...

  my $type = CustomStr;
  my %info = column_info_from_type($type);
